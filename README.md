# AsiaHtmlBible
This is a project I began 21 years ago.  Finally found a home so its easier for others to get to.  Thank you to all the supporters of GITHUB!
Where it works:
This is a bible note system that can be "translated" into any langauge that google (or a free ttf from another source) supports.  It is written in html 5 and css 3.  So no database!  New translations are done with search and replace in the menu system and a file renamer for the files (requires a language code change)  It works in MAC, Windows, Linux, BSD, Android and Ipad.  (Dont have OS2 to test it there)  It also works in a desktoop, laptop and tablet.  It can be edited offline or in a personal cloud.  
Why:
The object is not only  for one to take notes but easily share one's notes with others.  That is why it is not a database.  It also helps one organize their study materials.  It is also expandable (and as I find new ideas many  could use I add to it)  It also supports multiple languages.  (right now there is 22 languages done to some varying degrees)  
How:
How did it start? I saw a need for many languages to have a system that no one would more likely make a system for as there is no money in that.  I'm not after money; I am after people learning.  I also use it for my own files.  I can't host all my files as there is to this date about 80gb.  Many folks have been generous!  I have  handed this out personally all these years.  Now GITHUB will host the system.
Credits:
Always everything is due to God.  Added to that is a wonderful gift God gave me, my mom.  She is mom to 59 kids!  As I writ eshe is 80 and still learning despite legally blind.  Thank you God for my Mom and thanks mom for passing so many good things to your children and this son.
